### Welcome! 👋

My name Jacob and I am a full-stack web developer. I love tackling problems I haven't encountered before. Because of this, computer programming has been a great fit. I am passionate about the ability technology has to enrich our lives and help humanity move forward. I want to do whatever I can to make that promise a reality.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an application for a group of Boys & Girls Clubs to help them track the way the children feel when starting and ending their time at the facility as well as how they feel about the programs offered so the administration has data to help them continuously improve the program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android Development.
- 🧠 I have had a lifelong love of learning, I love diving deeply into the things I want to learn to do my best to understand them in a more holistic way.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I am proficient in Kotlin,  Java, Spring Framework, Maven, Gradle, HTML/CSS, React/Redux and vanilla JavaScript
- 🐧 I first fell in love with computers when I installed Linux on a Pentium laptop close to 20 years ago, it took a lot of work but I was hooked once I felt the satisfaction of getting something to work the way I wanted.
- ⚡ My Hobbies include reading, tinkering with computers (I built myself a home server with multiple Virtual Machines running under VMware ESXi) and spending time taking advantage of all the beautiful recreation areas we have available in Montana to go fishing, hiking and camping.
