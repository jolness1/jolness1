### Welcome! 👋

My name is Jacob and I am a software developer by training and am working at [Montana Free Press](https://montanafreepress.org/) as a data journalist. 
🗞️ I am passionate about the impact good, non-partisan journalism can have on people's ability to make informed decisions. We live in a news desert here so contributing to MTFP's mission has been a dream come true.
