### Welcome! 👋

My name is Jacob and I am a software developer by training and am working at [Montana Free Press](https://montanafreepress.org/) as a data journalist. 

🗞️ I am passionate about the impact good, non-partisan journalism can have on people's ability to make informed decisions. Coverage of State and Local politics here is limited so I am glad to contribute to MTFP's mission.
